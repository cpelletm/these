	abstract = {Understanding the effect of vibrations on the relaxation process of individual spins is crucial for implementing nanosystems for quantum information and quantum metrology applications. In this work, we present a theoretical microscopic model to describe the spin-lattice relaxation of individual electronic spins associated to negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, although our results can be extended to other spin-boson systems. Starting from a general spin-lattice interaction Hamiltonian, we provide a detailed description and solution of the quantum master equation of an electronic spin-one system coupled to a phononic bath in thermal equilibrium. Special attention is given to the dynamics of one-phonon processes below 1 K where our results agree with recent experimental findings and analytically describe the temperature and magnetic-field scaling. At higher temperatures, linear and second-order terms in the interaction Hamiltonian are considered and the temperature scaling is discussed for acoustic and quasilocalized phonons when appropriate. Our results, in addition to confirming a T5 temperature dependence of the longitudinal relaxation rate at higher temperatures, in agreement with experimental observations, provide a theoretical background for modeling the spin-lattice relaxation at a wide range of temperatures where different temperature scalings might be expected.},

Lovchinsky et al. exploited the magnetic properties of a single spin associated with a defect in diamond and manipulated it with a quantum-logic protocol. They demonstrated the magnetic resonance detection and spectroscopy of multiple nuclear species within individual ubiquitin proteins attached to a specially treated diamond surface at room temperature.Science, this issue p. 836Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the structural analysis of organic compounds and biomolecules but typically requires macroscopic sample quantities. We use a sensor, which consists of two quantum bits corresponding to an electronic spin and an ancillary nuclear spin, to demonstrate room temperature magnetic resonance detection and spectroscopy of multiple nuclear species within individual ubiquitin proteins attached to the diamond surface. Using quantum logic to improve readout fidelity and a surface-treatment technique to extend the spin coherence time of shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers, we demonstrate magnetic field sensitivity sufficient to detect individual proton spins within 1 second of integration. This gain in sensitivity enables high-confidence detection of individual proteins and allows us to observe spectral features that reveal information about their chemical composition.},

    abstract = { A new technique for performing electron nuclear double resonance experiments, based on the observation of electron spin echoes, has been developed. Radio-frequency resonance transitions are induced during the time interval between pulses II and III of a stimulated echo sequence, and cause a fall in the echo signal amplitude. Echo signals are integrated by means of a boxcar circuit and made to operate a pen recorder which plots the endor spectrum as the radio frequency is varied. The method does not depend on achieving any particular balance between relaxation rates, and has been applied in studying the Ce-W system in (Ca, Ce) WO4 down to very low radio frequencies. Three microwave pulses are required in order to generate a stimulated electron echo (figure 17 (a)). According to the classical description, in terms of a co-ordinate system rotating at the microwave frequency, the first pulse, which is a 90° pulse, turns the spins into the equatorial plane where they precess freely for a time ז, some advancing and some lagging the microwave field in phase. The second pulse, like the first a 90° pulse, has an effect which varies according to the phase divergence of the spins. Those which precess exactly at the microwave frequency, or which have diverged by a multiple of 2π, are turned along the polar axis in a direction opposite to that of their original alinement; the two 90° pulses are, for these spins, equivalent to a single 180° pulse. Spins which have diverged by an odd multiple of π are turned back into their original alinement as if no pulses had been applied. Other spins are turned by varying amounts, the overall effects being to leave a sinusoidal spectral pattern of periodicity 2π/ז in place of the original smooth line shape (figure 17 (b)). This pattern will persist for a relatively long time T, limited by lattice relaxation, or by spectral diffusion, but not by the phase memory time observed in normal spin echoes. The third microwave pulse of the stimulated echo sequence, also a 90° pulse, turns the Mz pattern into the equatorial plane where a phase convergence takes place, leading to the emission of a stimulated echo signal a time ז later. If this simple picture is to be applicable, the microwave field strength H1 should be several times greater than the resonance line width. Such large fields, and the corresponding short pulse times, are not always convenient in electron echo experiments, nor are they usually necessary. Echoes can be obtained with lower fields, although the behaviour of the spins becomes more complicated (Bloom 1955). In practice one can visualize the situation sufficiently well by imagining a spectrum of spins ~ 2H1 wide to be selected and to constitute the effective resonance line. }

	abstract = {The quantum properties of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) defect in diamond can be used as an atomic compass needle that is sensitive to tiny variations in magnetic field. Schmitt et al. and Boss et al. successfully enhanced this sensitivity by several orders of magnitude (see the Perspective by Jordan). They applied a sequence of pulses to the NV center, the timing of which was set by and compared with a highly stable oscillator. This allowed them to measure the frequency of an oscillating magnetic field (megahertz bandwidth) with submillihertz resolution. Such enhanced precision measurement could be applied, for example, to improve nuclear magnetic resonance-based imaging protocols of single molecules.Science, this issue p. 832, p. 837; see also p. 802Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 104 for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.},

abstract ={Recently, remarkable advances have been made in coupling a number of high-Q modes of nano-mechanical systems to high-finesse optical cavities, with the goal of reaching regimes in which quantum behavior can be observed and leveraged toward new applications. To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere.},

When mechanical resonators are scaled down to nanometer-scale dimensions, these forces can be harnessed to enable coupling to individual quantum systems. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a single electronic spin associated with a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond can be coupled to the motion of a magnetized mechanical resonator. Coherent manipulation of the spin is used to sense driven and Brownian motion of the resonator under ambient conditions with a precision below 6 picometers. With future improvements, this technique could be used to detect mechanical zero-point fluctuations, realize strong spin-phonon coupling at a single quantum level, and implement quantum spin transducers.},

abstract ={Measurement of the instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion of suspended particles in liquid probes the microscopic foundations of statistical mechanics in soft condensed matter. However, instantaneous velocity has eluded experimental observation for more than a century since Einsteinï¿œs prediction of the small length and time scales involved. We report shot-noiseï¿œlimited, high-bandwidth measurements of Brownian motion of micrometer-sized beads suspended in water and acetone by an optical tweezer. We observe the hydrodynamic instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion in a liquid, which follows a modified energy equipartition theorem that accounts for the kinetic energy of the fluid displaced by the moving bead. We also observe an anticorrelated thermal force, which is conventionally assumed to be uncorrelated.},

abstract ={Using an optical tweezers apparatus, we demonstrate three-dimensional control of nanodiamonds in solution with simultaneous readout of ground-state electron-spin resonance (ESR) transitions in an ensemble of diamond nitrogen-vacancy color centers. Despite the motion and random orientation of nitrogen-vacancy centers suspended in the optical trap, we observe distinct peaks in the measured ESR spectra qualitatively similar to the same measurement in bulk. Accounting for the random dynamics, we model the ESR spectra observed in an externally applied magnetic field to enable dc magnetometry in solution. We estimate the dc magnetic field sensitivity based on variations in ESR line shapes to be approximately . This technique may provide a pathway for spin-based magnetic, electric, and thermal sensing in fluidic environments and biophysical systems inaccessible to existing scanning probe techniques.},

abstract="The motion of a single charged particle in a Paul trap in the presence of the damping force is investigated theoretically and the modified stability diagrams in the parameter space are calculated. The results show that the stable regions in thea--q parameter plane are not only enlarged but also shifted. Consequently, the damping force causes instability in some cases, contrary to intuition. As a by-product of the calculation, we derive new theoretical approximate expressions for the secular-oscillation frequency. In the limiting case of no damping, these formulas are in good agreement with early measurements done by Wuerker et al.",
