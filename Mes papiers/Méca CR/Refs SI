When  they  become  res-onant, the polarization of the different orientations canthen  be  exchanged  in  a  process  called  cross-relaxation.
The conditions on the magnetic field for a cross-relaxation to happen are described in Sec. I of the Supplementary Material (SM).

The change in orientation of the total magnetic field can be visualized in Sec. I of the SM.
