	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0257},
	abstract = {Precise characterization of a hyperfine interaction is a prerequisite for high fidelity manipulations of electron and nuclear spins belonging to a hybrid qubit register in diamond. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme for determining a hyperfine interaction, using single-quantum and zero-quantum Ramsey fringes, by applying it to the system of a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) center and a \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C nuclear spin in the 1\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{st\}\}\$ shell. The zero-quantum Ramsey fringe, analogous to the quantum beat in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-type level structure, particularly enhances the measurement precision for non-secular hyperfine terms. Precisions less than 0.5 MHz in the estimation of all the components in the hyperfine tensor were achieved. Furthermore, for the first time we experimentally determined the principal axes of the hyperfine interaction in the system. Beyond the 1\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{st\}\}\$ shell, this method can be universally applied to other \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C nuclear spins interacting with the NV center.},

	abstract = {Using a HartmanÀHahn protocol, we demonstrate spin polarization transfer from a single, optically polarized nitrogenvacancy (NV) center to the ensemble of paramagnetic defects hosted by an individual diamond nanocrystal. Owing to the strong NVÀbath coupling, the transfer takes place on a short, microsecond time scale. Upon fast repetition of the pulse sequence, we observe strong polarization transfer blockade, which we interpret as an indication of spin bath cooling. Numerical simulations indicate that the spin bath polarization is nonuniform throughout the nanoparticle, averaging approximately 5\% over the crystal volume, but reaching up to 25\% in the immediate vicinity of the NV. These observations may prove relevant to the planning of future bath-assisted magnetometry tests.},
