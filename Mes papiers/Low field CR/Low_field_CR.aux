(a) Sequence used to measure the spin lifetime : the laser is turned off for a time $\tau $ twice and the spin state is read at the end of the dark time by measuring the initial photoluminescence when the laser is turned back on. A microwave resonant with one of the spin transition is used in one of the sequence to project the $\ket {0}$ spin sate in either $\ket {+1}$ or $\ket {-1}$. The sequence result is the subtraction $S_1-S_2$.
