\maketitle
Blabla sur les NV, les ensembles etc.

In this letter/article, we characterize the depolarization of the spins observed for dense ensemble of NV centers in zero magnetic field and its potential application for DC magnetometry. While the main mechanism behind the depolarization, the lift in the degeneracy between the four classes of NV centers, is already well studied and can be exploited in a microwave-less vector magnetometry protocol, we found two other depolarization mechanisms specific to the zero-field region which could play an important role in the low-field magnetometry protocol.

The $T_1$ depolarization dynamics of single or sparse NV centers at room temperature is dominated by a two-phonon Raman process, which depends on the crystal lattice temperature but does not (?) depend on the external magnetic field. However, it has been observed that dense NV centers ensemble have an additional spin lifetime contribution which depends greatly on the magnetic field and not on the temperature. This effect has been attributed to cross-relaxation between the NV centers through dipole-dipole coupling. Some inhomogeneity between the NV centers is further needed in order to explain the depolarization of the spin ensemble.

The main signature of the spin depolarization in low field is the characteristic dip in photoluminescence (PL) observed only for high density ($\gtrsim 1$ ppm) of NV centers, as shown on fig [X]. The decrease in the spins' lifetime in zero field makes the optical polarization scheme of the NV centers less effective and therefore reduce the population of the bright $\ket{0}$ spin state. The reason for the decrease in PL at higher magnetic field values is the mixing of the bright spin state $\ket{0}$ to the darker state $\ket{-1}$ induced by the transverse magnetic field. This effect does not modify (on first approximation) the spins' lifetime, and is common to both dense and sparse samples.
