abstract = {Abstract Magnetic field sensors that exploit quantum effects have shown that they can outperform classical sensors in terms of sensitivity enabling a range of novel applications in future, such as a brain machine interface. Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a promising high sensitivity platform for measuring magnetic fields at room temperature. Transferring this technology from laboratory setups into products and applications, the total size of the sensor, the overall power consumption, and the costs need to be reduced and optimized. Here, a fiber-based NV magnetometer featuring a complete integration of all functional components is demonstrated without using any bulky laboratory equipment. This integrated prototype allows portable measurement of magnetic fields with a sensitivity of 344 pT Hz−1/2.},

A brief survey of the physical significance of the constants in the spin Hamiltonian, as well as experimental technique, is given. The various nitrogen centres are discussed treating exchange-interaction, Jahn-Teller and relaxation effects associated with these centres. The spin Hamiltonian parameters of these centres are tabled and the results are discussed within the framework of the defect molecule approach. In conclusion, the correlation between optical effects and the ESR measurements in the case of four defect centres are discussed in some detail as this seems to be a powerful method of testing the various models suggested for the observed defects.}

Given this array of existing and potential applications and the almost 50 years of NV research, one would expect that the physics of the centre is well understood, however, the study of the NV centre has proved challenging, with many early assertions now believed false and many remaining issues yet to be resolved. This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined."

Magnetic imaging with nanometric resolution and field detection capabilities in the nanotesla range are enabled by the atomic-size and exceptionally long spin-coherence times of this naturally occurring defect. The exciting perspectives that ensue from these characteristics have triggered vivid experimental activities in the emerging field of ‘NV magnetometry’. It is the purpose of this article to review the recent progress in high-sensitivity nanoscale NV magnetometry, generate an overview of the most pertinent results of the last years and highlight perspectives for future developments. We will present the physical principles that allow for magnetic field detection with NV centres and discuss first applications of NV magnetometers that have been demonstrated in the context of nano magnetism, mesoscopic physics and the life sciences.}

	abstract = {Diamond hosts a wide variety of colour centres that have demonstrated outstanding optical and spin properties. Among them, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre is by far the most investigated owing to its superior characteristics, which promise the development of highly sophisticated quantum devices, in particular for sensing applications. Nevertheless, harnessing the potential of these centres mainly relies on the availability of high quality and purity diamond single crystals that need to be specially designed and engineered for this purpose. Plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has become a key enabling technology in this field of research. Nitrogen can indeed be directly doped in situ into a high crystalline quality diamond matrix in a controlled way, allowing the production of single isolated centres or ensembles that can potentially be integrated into a device. In this paper we will provide an overview of the requirements for synthesizing ‘quantum-grade’ diamond films using CVD. These include the reduction of impurities and surrounding spins that limit coherence times, the control of NV density in a wide range of concentrations as well as their spatial localization within the diamond. Enhancing the charge state and preferential orientation of the colour centres is also discussed. These improvements in material fabrication have contributed to positioning diamond as one of the most promising solid-state quantum systems and the first industrial applications in sensing are just starting to emerge.}

abstract = "Growing high-purity diamond containing dense negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV−) centre ensembles is desirable for the development of sensitive quantum sensors that explore the coherent manipulation of the spin states of this atomic-scale defect. By using N2O as a dopant, we demonstrate that millimetre-thick single crystals can be grown by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) with substitutional nitrogen concentrations as high as 26 ppm. With a high-energy electron irradiation treatment and in-situ annealing, up to 20% of this nitrogen can be successfully converted into NV− centres leading to densities of almost 5 ppm and to a crystal displaying pink colouration and appealing optical properties. The longitudinal relaxation T1 time in such a highly doped diamond is measured to be around 3.5 ms at 300 K while inhomogeneous dephasing time T2∗ is estimated to 600 ns. Despite the high NV density, Electron Spin Resonance lines are resolved with clear hyperfine splitting induced by the nuclear spin of nitrogen. The dependence of T1 on the orientation of the magnetic field suggests that relaxation is dominated by NV-NV dipole interactions when no magnetic field is applied. Such engineered crystals constitute a promising platform for developing future quantum sensing applications."

NV− centers are formed from substitutional nitrogen (P1 centers) defects and vacancies in the diamond lattice. Maximizing the concentration of NVs is most beneficial, which justifies the search for methods with a high yield of conversion from P1 to NV−. We report here the characterization of surface cleaned fluorescent micro- and nanodiamonds, obtained by irradiation of commercial diamond powder with high-energy (10 MeV) electrons and simultaneous annealing at 800 ∘C. Using this technique and increasing the irradiation dose, we demonstrate the creation of NV− with up to 25% conversion yield. Finally, we monitor the creation of irradiation-induced spin-1 defects in microdiamond particles, which we associate with W16 and W33 centers, and investigate the effects of irradiation dose and particle size on the coherence time of NV−."

	abstract = {Understanding the effect of vibrations on the relaxation process of individual spins is crucial for implementing nanosystems for quantum information and quantum metrology applications. In this work, we present a theoretical microscopic model to describe the spin-lattice relaxation of individual electronic spins associated to negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, although our results can be extended to other spin-boson systems. Starting from a general spin-lattice interaction Hamiltonian, we provide a detailed description and solution of the quantum master equation of an electronic spin-one system coupled to a phononic bath in thermal equilibrium. Special attention is given to the dynamics of one-phonon processes below 1 K where our results agree with recent experimental findings and analytically describe the temperature and magnetic-field scaling. At higher temperatures, linear and second-order terms in the interaction Hamiltonian are considered and the temperature scaling is discussed for acoustic and quasilocalized phonons when appropriate. Our results, in addition to confirming a T5 temperature dependence of the longitudinal relaxation rate at higher temperatures, in agreement with experimental observations, provide a theoretical background for modeling the spin-lattice relaxation at a wide range of temperatures where different temperature scalings might be expected.},

	abstract = {Precise characterization of a hyperfine interaction is a prerequisite for high fidelity manipulations of electron and nuclear spins belonging to a hybrid qubit register in diamond. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme for determining a hyperfine interaction, using single-quantum and zero-quantum Ramsey fringes, by applying it to the system of a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) center and a \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C nuclear spin in the 1\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{st\}\}\$ shell. The zero-quantum Ramsey fringe, analogous to the quantum beat in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-type level structure, particularly enhances the measurement precision for non-secular hyperfine terms. Precisions less than 0.5 MHz in the estimation of all the components in the hyperfine tensor were achieved. Furthermore, for the first time we experimentally determined the principal axes of the hyperfine interaction in the system. Beyond the 1\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{st\}\}\$ shell, this method can be universally applied to other \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C nuclear spins interacting with the NV center.},

	abstract = {Using a HartmanÀHahn protocol, we demonstrate spin polarization transfer from a single, optically polarized nitrogenvacancy (NV) center to the ensemble of paramagnetic defects hosted by an individual diamond nanocrystal. Owing to the strong NVÀbath coupling, the transfer takes place on a short, microsecond time scale. Upon fast repetition of the pulse sequence, we observe strong polarization transfer blockade, which we interpret as an indication of spin bath cooling. Numerical simulations indicate that the spin bath polarization is nonuniform throughout the nanoparticle, averaging approximately 5\% over the crystal volume, but reaching up to 25\% in the immediate vicinity of the NV. These observations may prove relevant to the planning of future bath-assisted magnetometry tests.},
