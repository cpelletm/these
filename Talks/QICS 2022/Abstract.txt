Magnetic sensing with NV center ensembles

The NV center is a particular crystal defect in diamond which belongs to the large family of "artificial atoms", solid state systems where the electrons are confined in all 3 dimensions which give rise to discrete energy levels similar to that of an atom. The particularity of the NV center resides in its spin, which can be prepared and read out optically, making the NV center one of the very few solid state spin qubit workable at room temperature.
During my talk, I will briefly describe some of the recent milestones realized with NV centers in the domains of quantum information and computation, after what I will describe my work in quantum sensing with dense ensemble of NV centers, where the dipole-dipole coupling between the NVs as welle as with other spin defects in the crystal starts to be noticeable. I will explain how we can use this coupling to our advantage, to probe other spins and to measure external magnetic field.
